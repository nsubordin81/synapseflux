title: What Is SynapseFlux?

Hello, and welcome to my blog synapseflux.com. I'm Taylor. I made this blog to explore
the topic of complexity. I think it is safe to call me a layperson in the field of 
complexity, in fact it is safe to call me a layperson in just about any field. 
But the idea of complexity is something I've been interested in for a long time, 
even though I haven't always had the label for it.

Maybe you share my interest in complexity. There is even a term, Complexity Bias, to
refer to the general human tendency to favor explanations that are more complex.

Complexity adds a mystery to life. How dull it would be if everything were understandable
at a glance? However, it can also lead some of us to believe that we have inherent 
limitations, which can be the source of great fear and self-doubt. 

I believe complexity in the creative field can be a powerful muse, but at the same 
time a paralyzing prison, trapping our minds in a labyrinth of our own echoed reasoning.

Complex systems exist all around us, and we encounter them every day. they can be 
natural or they can arise from constructs we create to entertain ourselves or explain our 
purpose for existence. 

So with such a prevalence of complex systems, questions are bound to come up that themselves
tend to be complex. These Questions can be about complexities and whether we can categorize them,
but they can also be about how different people interact with complexity. 

For example, 
<ul>
    <li>at what point can you call something complex?</li>
    <li> How much of a person's ability to cope with complexity is inherent? </li>
    <li> What do different reactions to complexity ultimately lead to?</li> 
    <li> Are there ways in which people think about complexity that complement each other?</li>
    <li>At what point are systems too complex for a single human mind, and what have we done as 
    a species to deal with that? </li>
    <li> Are there optimal strategies for dealing with complexity that would 
    help us navigate a life that is teeming with it?</li>
</ul>

I hope to examine complexity from different angles in my blog. Here are a few ideas I 
have so far I may explore:
<ul>
<li> find complex systems and write about them from the perspective of complexity. </li>
<li> examine different ways people set the threshold for what is considered complex </li>
<li> find complexities that arise in my own professional and hobby work (art, music, games, programming)</li>
</ul>
Alternatively, in keeping with the unpredictablility inherent with the complex, I may just wing it! I 
look forward to your readership.
