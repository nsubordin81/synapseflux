title: What Is SynapseFlux?

So as the maiden post of this blog, what I’m writing now should set some kind of direction, right?

A short apology for what I'm guessing will be some clumsy writing. Bear with me, I'm still getting the hang of this type of written communication. I don’t write often. My hope is that keeping a blog will change that.

So what is this blog going to be about? Let me lay some groundwork. I have a tendency to want to always take a broader view of topics. I'm discouraged that most advice on writing blogs suggest a narrow topic space. Focused blogs have the advantages digestible content and creativity within constraints. 

The problem is, I see myself wanting to explore across a range of topics. I would like to be able to have both the advantages of a focused blog with the freedom offered by a free form journal.

So I arrive at a compromise. I'm selecting 'progress through association' as my blog's theme. This topic provides some boundaries. Yet, it also gives me license to mold and play with those boundaries until I find something that fits. 

Synapse Flux as an idea came before the plan to write about progress through association. I'm pleased with the symmetry this represents. The name Synapse Flux sprung from seeming nothingness in my mind.  The flow of synapses is a great  example of progress through association. 

My mind found a label for my interest that evokes common ideas in others. I may spend a long time trying to flesh out the topic on this site. My mind though has already fashioned a symbol to unlock a powerful evocation of its own. 

'Progress by association' leads to emergent themes. Themes of learning, pattern matching, asking bold questions and multidisciplinary fusions. 

Exploring how progress can come from associating ideas is of great interest to me. I hope the product of this blog expands this interest and spurs like minded pursuits.
