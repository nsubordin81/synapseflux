title: What Is SynapseFlux?

SynapseFlux is meant to evoke the idea of an unsupressed, unfiltered flow of thought, the raw and organic process
of ideation, and also the name I want my someday/maybe game studio to have.
It came to me in a flight of fancy. This qualifies it as a good name in my book,
no matter what marketing and SEO might say to the contrary.

And the name is a good way for me to segway into the intended theme of this blog. 
The tension between belief structures that emerged during the Empiricism, Rationalism, Romanticism and Victorianism/Realism periods
persists in modern society. Part of the purpose of this blog is to support this observation with examples, but
it will likely focus mostly on the influence of Romanticism. The blog will be considered successful if it can bring some 
of those feelings, imaginings and examinations championed by this thought movement into our consciousness; if it can give us appreciation for those
accented moments of feeling and awe which drive our convictions and strengthen our resolves.

Consider those moments when you've you find something you weren't expecting, come up with a solution to a problem because
you simply gave in to the mystery of your mind, become giddy talking with a friend building imaginary scenarios
or chasing the absurd. What about those times life felt surreal, even for a moment? Perhaps when you were able to take a moment
to reflect that you truly were on a grand adventure? How about times that were hard but eventually the loss and 
obstacles brought new insight and strength from unknown reserves? It is the intention of SynapseFlux to dive into this space in as many
ways as this humble mind can conceive of, or even better pull from others and present, synthesized, for your consumption.

This could take the form of cataloged experience, art, music, fiction, research, biographic portraits, and perhaps 
someday even an interactive experience. 


So welcome, buckle up, I hope to see you again somewhere down the line.
