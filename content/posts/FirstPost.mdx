title: What Is SynapseFlux?

SynapseFlux is the name of this blog, and also the name I wanted my someday game studio to have.
It came to me in a flight of fancy. I think that qualifies it as a good name,
no matter what marketing and SEO might say to the contrary.

And the name is a good way for me to segway into the intended topic of this blog. the name represents one of 
those moments where you find something you weren't expecting, come up with a solution to a problem because
you gave in to the mystery of your mind. It is the intention of SynapseFlux dive into this space in as many
ways as this simple mind can conceive of, to stand at the crossroads of romanticism and pragmatism in this world
and examine how each fuels the other. 

This could take the form of cataloged experience, art, music, fiction, research, biographic portraits, and perhaps 
someday even an interactive experience. So welcome, buckle up, I hope to see you again somewhere down the line.
