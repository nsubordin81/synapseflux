title: What Is SynapseFlux?

Hello, and welcome to my blog synapseflux.com. I'm Taylor. I made this blog to explore
the topic of complexity. I think it is safe to call me a layperson in the field of 
complexity, in fact it is safe to call me a layperson in just about any field. 
But the idea of complexity is something I've been interested in for a long time, 
even though I haven't always had the label for it.

Maybe you share my interest in complexity. There is even a term, Complexity Bias, to
refer to the general human tendency to favor explanations that are more complex.

Complexity adds a mystery to life. How dull it would be if everything were understandable
at a glance. However, it can also lead some of us to believe that we have inherent 
limitations, which can be the source of great fear and self-doubt. 

I believe complexity in the creative field can be a powerful muse, but at the same 
time a paralyzing prison, trapping our minds in a labyrinth of our own echoed reasoning.

Complex systems exist all around us, and we encounter them every day. Whether they are 
natural or they arise from constructs we create to entertain ourselves or explain our 
purpose, feelings and relationships to our environment and each other. 

So naturally questions come up, both about these complexities and whether we can categorize them,
but also about how different people interact with complexity. How much of a person's ability
to cope with complexity is inherent? What do different reactions to complexity ultimately 
lead to? Are there complementary aspects to coping strategies that have net positive effects? 
At what point are systems too complex for a single human mind, and what have we done as a 
species to deal with that? Are there optimal strategies for dealing with complexity that 
would help us navigate a life that is teeming with it?

I hope to examine complexity from different angles in my blog. I may tackle 
are to find complex systems and write about them from the perspective of complexity. 
I may talk about different ways people often interpret what makes something complex, 
and I may consider some topics that have interested me as a profession or a hobby and 
look at the complexities that many tackle in these fields.
