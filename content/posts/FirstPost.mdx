Hello, and welcome to my blog synapseflux.com. I'm Taylor.

It has been difficult coming up with a topic for my blog. I don't consider myself an expert
in any one field. I get caught up in things, to be sure, but often want to move on before my 
understanding gets beyond that initial superficial enthusiasm. I could share my experience or findings
with you in some of these areas, but you would feel like it was worth your time and attention? 

Perhaps not. 

So instead, this blog is a commitment to take those interests, have discoveries and experiences
worthy of your attention, and then share them.

The first interest I'm going to pick is something nice and broad: Complexity.

I find myself overcomplicating things all the time. It doesn't really matter what it is. 
This tendency is something I've observed in others at times too, though not always to the 
same degree. So that has me thinking that the topic of complexity itself deserves some 
examination and attention. I've come up with some preliminary questions.

For example, 
<ul>
    <li>at what point can you call something complex?</li>
    <li> How much of a person's ability to cope with complexity is inherent? </li>
    <li> What do different reactions to complexity ultimately lead to?</li> 
    <li> Are there ways in which people think about complexity that complement each other?</li>
    <li>At what point are systems too complex for a single human mind, and what have we done as 
    a species to deal with that? </li>
    <li> Are there optimal strategies for dealing with complexity that would 
    help us navigate a life that is teeming with it?</li>
</ul>

I hope to examine complexity from different angles in my blog. Here are a few ideas I 
have so far I may explore:
<ul>
<li> find complex systems and write about them from the perspective of complexity. </li>
<li> examine different ways people set the threshold for what is considered complex </li>
<li> find complexities that arise in my own professional and hobby work (art, music, games, programming)</li>
</ul>
Alternatively, in keeping with the unpredictablility inherent with the complex, I may just wing it! I 
look forward to your readership.
