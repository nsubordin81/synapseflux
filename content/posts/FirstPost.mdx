title: What Is SynapseFlux?

So as the maiden post of this blog, this post should set some kind of direction, right?

I'm still finding my bearings here but I'll give it the old college try.

So what is this blog going to be about? Let me lay some groundwork. I have a tendency to want to always take a broader view of topics. I'm discouraged that most advice on writing blogs suggest a narrow topic space. Focused blogs have the advantages digestible content and creativity within constraints. 

The problem is, I see myself wanting to explore across a range of topics. I would like to be able to have both the advantages of a focused blog with the freedom offered by a free form journal.

So I arrive at a compromise. I'm selecting 'progress through association' as my blog's theme. This topic provides some boundaries. Yet, it also gives me license to mold and play with those boundaries until I find something that fits. 

Synapse Flux as an idea for the name precededed the plan to write about progress through association. This could be seen as a reinforcing and self-affirming happenstance. I don't recall precisely what sequence of thoughts led to the 
name 'SynapseFlux', but I latched onto it because I liked the sound and could think of many interpretations for it. For example, The flow of synapses is a great  example of progress through association. 

It is exciting to think that my mind generated such a label for my interests that could evoke common ideas in others. I may spend a long time trying to flesh out detailed representations of this idea on this blog. My mind, though, took a much shorter time to fashion a symbol to unlock a powerful evocation of its own. 

'Progress by association' is meant to evoke themes of learning, pattern matching, asking bold questions and using intuition and conversation to drive emergent connections across a multidisciplinary space. 

Exploring how progress can come from associating ideas is of great interest to me. I hope the product of this blog expands this interest and spurs like minded pursuits.
