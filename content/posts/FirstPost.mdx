Hello World!

Blog posts are hard. What you do say? Maybe a 3rd Grade approach. My name is Taylor. I'm from the U.S. I like Computer Programming, Stats, Music, Art, Game Design, Stories, Novelty, and things I'm forgetting. 
Do you like those things too? If so, you might like what I eventually write here. I'll try and keep it organized. 

All the best in your browsing time, 
Taylor
