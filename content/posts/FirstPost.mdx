title: What Is SynapseFlux?

So as the maiden post of this blog, what I'm writing now should set some kind of direction, right?

You'll have to forgive me, I don't write often. Hopefully with a blog that habit will change. 

So what is this blog going to be about? I suffer from a tendency to want to always broaden scope, 
I don't like that blogs are encouraged to find a very narrow niche within a topic space. However, 
I can appreciate that constraints breed creativity and focused content is more digestible and
browsable.

So, in an effort to appease that blog wisdom while also giving myself license to mold and play with 
my blog's topic until I find something that fits, I'm selecting 'progress through association' as 
my blog's theme.

This fits the domain name of my blog too. This is good because I started with the title, thinking that 
if I could put the idea I wanted SynapseFlux to express into words, it would match my interest.
The flow of synapses is a great foundational example of progress through association. Learning,
analyzing patterns, making novel connections and celebrating the sublime serendipity of life are 
but a few roads I'd like to travel down, across disciplines and through different media. 

I don't know about you, but I'm excited. I hope the product is as much fun as I expect to have working on it.
