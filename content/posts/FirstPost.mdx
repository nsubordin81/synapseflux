Hello! Welcome to my pet project. This is probably my 4th rewrite of my first ever blog post. Lucky you, I've spared
you of all of the false starts. I promise, you won't miss them. 

The most important thing I think I should tell you at this point is that this blog will be about learning. Learning is
a broad topic, I know, and I don't intend to tackle everything that can be considered learning. 

Instead, at least as we get started, I will focus on a few subjects that peak my fascination. For now that list is 
limited to building software, creating art, composing music, exploring how the brain functions, designing games, 
stifling your feelings, and humor (har, har).

I hope to tackle these subjects from many learning approaches, with the hope of finding better ways to both 
communicate their fundamentals as well as determine the best way to make them and other concepts more digestible. 

Some ideas off the top of my head are to look to masters and polymaths who we tend to idolize for techniques, 
research what we now know of how learning works for strategies to apply, apply rigorous practice and record my results,
and principally try to traverse as many avenues of existing inquiry into them as is possible. 

I also hope to make some games applying some of these disciplines, so hopefully I can also share some of that experience
here. 

Happy to have you as a reader, I hope to post frequently enough to get some good content here for your enjoyment.
