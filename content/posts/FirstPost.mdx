Hello, and welcome to my blog synapseflux.com. I'm Taylor.

Congratulations first of all on finding this page! I don't know what you typed into your search engine of choice to get here. Maybe you are a friend and I gave you this link. Maybe, like 
me, you like the sound of 'SynapseFlux' for a domain and wanted to see if anyone owned it. Hope you aren't disappointed to see that I do. I have actually, for some time.

Having a little space on the internet was a goal I set for myself when I learned it was possible back in 1999 or so. I realized that dream at some point in the last 7 years when I took the plunge and
purchased synapseflux.com. Since that time, not much happened with it. The one thing I had on here for a few years was a simple game I made in an HTML5 game development course through Udacity.

I'm determined to make something more out of this, and I hope that the content I find for it will be something you, my random, anonymous audience, will find in some way tickles your fancy, resonates, or 
maybe even informs on some level. 

I plan to start with some musings I have about work I already do in programming, and about hobbies I have like art, music and game design. Since video games themselves tie this all together, you could think of that
as the theme of this blog. However, Each of these disciplines is a world unto itself, so we'll probably go wide and deep on all of it. 

Looking forward to your readership once I can start posting regularly. 

Regards, 
Taylor
