> _It's the way I study - to understand something by trying to work it out or,
  in other words, to understand something by creating it. Not creating it one hundred 
  percent, of course; but taking a hint as to which direction to go
  but not remembering the details. These you work out for yourself._..
  -Richard Feynman

My first post. Please bear with me as I develop a writing voice. The quote above more or less captures
my purpose in creating this blog. 

When I think of my own education and experience since leaving school, surveying across all of my skills
and hobbies, I can claim only some shallow understanding in all of those areas. 
It is humbling to realize how little I actually know, even in areas I have spent a lot of time focusing. 

There is so much room for admiration in what Richard Feynman was able to achieve, both in his depth of 
understanding of Physics and how competently he was able to convey it.

Yet what he is suggesting here demands rigor, and it is scary. it suggests that the way that I learned
leaves me without a deep understanding of the subjects I care about, and the only way to repair this
gap is to attempt to recreate the problem solving that others have already toiled through for the 
prize of truly understanding it myself. 

This sounds like a revolutionary idea in a society in which my first instinct is to google something
or open up an instructional video or textbook where I can passively consume answers. After all, 
aren't all of the tools so sophisticated now that reverse engineering them is a waste of time and 
we should be focusing on how to best use what others have done for us?

This reasoning was what I listened to in the past, but I find that consuming content only gets one
so far, and with our limited time on earth it is worth understanding things a little deeper so that
we can make that much stronger of a contribution to progress. Armed with the conviction to put this suggestion 
into practice, I submit to you a blog where I will record my efforts to change my practices and the 
observations they yield.

Thank you for your interest, stop by again soon. With some hard work and a lot of help getting started,
maybe I can make it worth your while.
